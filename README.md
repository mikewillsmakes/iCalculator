# iCalculator
A web calculator solution for iPad users

I put iCalculator together as part of my journey to learning JavaScript. I could only manage to get a calculator to work by using the eval() function â€” which i soon discovered was an unsafe coding practice. So, i followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&t=1554s) by Web Dev Simplified to see how he would solve this. Full JS code credit to Web Dev Simplified. CSS by me, based off of Apple's visual language from the iPhone Calculator app. 

The reason i chose to do this initially was because iPad does not come with a default calculator app. So i figured it would be useful to learn how to make something that i could actully get some use out of.
